<div>WHEATLEY: Alright, first off… I’m sorry for what I did when I was all powerful. Believe it or not, I genuinely regret it. It doesn’t seem like there’s much else we can do than just working with what we’ve got and just living here for a while. Trust me, I saw it from space. What do you think? Can we come to this compromise?
