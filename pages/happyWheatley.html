<h1>The Unofficial Portal 3</h1>
<hr>
<h4>Happy Wheatley Ending</h4>
<div>You simply nod your head in agreement.
<br>
WHEATLEY: Really?! Oh, that’s great! So you’ll let me stay with you? Anything beats staying in space forever… wonder what happened to that other core I was with…
<br>
Slightly more reluctantly, you nod your head again. Maybe, just maybe, hopefully, if you’re lucky and things go well, this won’t be so bad. Now you, the player, may be asking, how does Chell survive, where is she getting food? And to that I say, does she eat at any point throughout both games? No. So this makes perfect sense in Portal canon.
